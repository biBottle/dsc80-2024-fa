## Introduction

In this project,  we do research on recipe and rating datasets. 
We have tried visual displays, hypothesis testing, and various models for prediction and learned a lot.  

---

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

This part we get the dataset and remove some extreme data.
---

## Assessment of Missingness

This part we delete NMAR values.

---

## Hypothesis Testing

## Baseline Model

Here is the result Mean Squared Error (MSE): 5127.871683313645 and result figure:

## Final Model

Here is the result Mean Squared Error (MSE): 5127.871683313645 and result figure:

## Fairness Analysis

Here is the result:  
Observed mean difference：-12.12
Permutation test p-value：0.0000
